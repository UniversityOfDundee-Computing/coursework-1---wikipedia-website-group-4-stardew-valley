        <p>Stardew Valley is a simulation role-playing video game developed by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. Players take
          the role of a character who takes over their deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place known as
          Stardew Valley. The game was released for Windows in February 2016 before being ported to several other
          computer, console, and mobile platforms.</p>

          <p><b>Stardew Valley</b> is open-ended, allowing players to take on activities such as growing crops, raising
            livestock, fishing, cooking, mining and foraging, and socializing with the townspeople, including the
            ability to marry and have children. It also allows up to four players to play online together. Barone
            developed Stardew Valley by himself over four years. He was heavily inspired by the Harvest Moon
            series, with additions to address some of the shortcomings of those games.</p>
